# Suggest Tasks Feature Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Suggest Tasks feature was failing with API validation error:
```
API call failed: 400 {"error":"Invalid input data","details":[{"field":"time","message":"Time must be in HH:MM format (24-hour)","value":""}]}
```

## Root Cause

The suggested tasks were being created with `time: ''` (empty string), but the API validation expects either:
- `null` for tasks without a specific time
- A valid time string in `HH:MM` format (24-hour)

## Solution Applied

Changed line 2499 in `index.html`:
```javascript
// Before (causing error)
time: '',

// After (fixed)
time: null,
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Updated Service Worker Cache**: Bumped version to `v5-suggest-fix` to force cache refresh
2. **Console Warnings**: The debug-helper.js and preload warnings are browser cache issues from previous versions

## Files Modified

- `index.html` (line 2499)
- `sw.js` (line 1)

## Testing

The "Suggest Tasks" feature should now work properly:
1. Enter a goal in the suggestion field
2. Click "Generate Tasks" 
3. Tasks should be created and saved without API validation errors

## Expected Behavior

- AI generates 3-5 relevant tasks based on your goal
- Each task gets an appropriate emoji
- Tasks are tagged as "suggested" 
- All tasks save successfully to the database
- No console errors during the process
