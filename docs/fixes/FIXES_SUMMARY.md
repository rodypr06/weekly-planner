# Weekly Planner Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Natural Language Parsing Issue - "clean bathroom at 1pm" splitting incorrectly
**Problem**: Task input "clean bathroom at 1pm" was being split into two separate tasks
**Root Cause**: 
- Inconsistent time extraction patterns in fallback parser
- AI prompt needed more explicit instructions

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reordered regex patterns to prioritize "at [time]" format
- Enhanced AI prompt with explicit example for "clean bathroom at 1pm"  
- Added bathroom-related emojis (üöø, üõÅ) to emoji map
- Added explicit instruction to keep full task descriptions together

**Files Modified**: `index.html` (lines 2281, 2289, 2341-2347, 2375)

### 2. NaN Task ID Error on Delete
**Problem**: Delete operations failing with "Task ID must be a positive integer, value: NaN"
**Root Cause**: Inconsistency between `dataset.taskId` and `dataset.id` usage

**Fixes Applied**:
- Standardized to use `dataset.id` consistently
- Added validation to prevent NaN task IDs from being processed
- Added error logging for debugging

**Files Modified**: `index.html` (lines 1643-1647, 2008)

### 3. Debug Helper Script Error
**Problem**: Console error "Unexpected token '<'" from debug-helper.js
**Root Cause**: Script tag trying to load file that doesn't exist in served context

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed the problematic script tag
- Added comment explaining removal

**Files Modified**: `index.html` (line 2697)

### 4. 404 Errors on Task Deletion
**Problem**: Some tasks showing 404 "not found" errors when attempting deletion
**Root Cause**: Tasks existing locally but not on server (sync issues)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced error handling to detect 404/not found errors
- Gracefully refresh view when task not found on server
- Improved user experience for sync-related issues

**Files Modified**: `index.html` (lines 2238-2246)

### 5. Enhanced Time Pattern Matching
**Problem**: Various time formats not being parsed correctly
**Root Cause**: Regex patterns in wrong order, not handling "at" prefix properly

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reordered time patterns for better matching priority
- Fixed "at" prefix handling in time extraction
- Improved 12/24 hour time conversion logic

**Files Modified**: `index.html` (lines 2341-2367)

## Test Files Created

1. `test-natural-language.html` - Debug tool for natural language parsing
2. `test-parsing-fix.html` - Comprehensive test suite for parsing fixes

## Summary

All critical console errors and functionality issues have been resolved:
- ‚úÖ Natural language parsing now correctly handles "clean bathroom at 1pm" 
- ‚úÖ Task deletion no longer fails with NaN errors
- ‚úÖ Console errors from debug-helper.js eliminated
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of 404 deletion errors
- ‚úÖ Enhanced time pattern matching for various formats

The application should now work smoothly without console errors and with proper task parsing.
