# Weekly Planner - Console Error Fixes and Development Server Setup
*Date: 2025-08-29*

## Session Summary
Fixed multiple console errors in the Weekly Planner application and created a development-friendly server configuration.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Console Error Fixes
- **setupDragAndDrop undefined reference** - Removed invalid function call at `index.html:2043`
- **Service Worker chrome-extension errors** - Added URL filtering to only cache HTTP/HTTPS requests in `sw.js:88-97`
- **Time parsing NaN errors** - Fixed undefined handling in time regex at `index.html:2352-2354`
- **Gemini API 400 validation errors** - Replaced overly restrictive regex with security-focused pattern detection in `middleware/security.js:283-290`
- **Preload resource warning** - Fixed filename mismatch from `supabase-auth.js` to `supabase-auth-fixed.js` at `index.html:35`

### 2. Development Server Setup
- **Created `server-dev.js`** - Development server without strict CSP restrictions
- **Added `npm run dev` script** - Easy command to start development server
- **Fixed SSL protocol errors** - Disabled `upgrade-insecure-requests` for development
- **Fixed CSP violations** - Disabled Content Security Policy restrictions for development

## Server Configuration

### Access URLs
- **Port:** 2324
- **Host:** 0.0.0.0 (network accessible)
- **Local:** http://localhost:2324
- **Network:** http://192.168.50.141:2324

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm start       # Production server with full security
npm run dev     # Development server without CSP restrictions
npm run build   # Build assets and CSS
```

## Git Commits
1. `0a2265f` - "üêõ Fix multiple console errors and improve stability"
2. `a866c2a` - "üõ†Ô∏è Add development server with relaxed security"

## Key Files Modified
- `index.html` - Fixed drag/drop, time parsing, preload issues
- `middleware/security.js` - Relaxed AI prompt validation
- `sw.js` - Added chrome-extension URL filtering
- `server-dev.js` - New development server (created)
- `package.json` - Added dev script

## Testing Notes
- Development server properly serves all static resources
- Health endpoint shows environment mode (development/production)
- Mobile devices can access via network IP for PWA testing
- All console errors resolved in development mode

## Future Considerations
- Production server (`server.js`) maintains full security with CSP
- Development server (`server-dev.js`) for local development only
- Both servers bind to 0.0.0.0 for network accessibility
